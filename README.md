# instacart-delivery-availability-check
Tiny python script that check's instacart's delivery availability and notifies you if a slot opens up.

### Quick setup guide:
- See `credentials_example.json` to create a `credentials.json` file and fill out all the fields with values!
- Install `helium`, `requests` and `win10toast` modules (all can be installed directly via pip).
- Pop up a notification toast on Windows 10, if you want another way of getting notified just modify the `send_simple_message` function!

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions!
